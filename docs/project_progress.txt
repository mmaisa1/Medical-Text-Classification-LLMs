You're making excellent progress, Medha! Here's a clear breakdown of **what you’ve done so far** and **how it aligns with the expected project outcomes**:

---

### ✅ **Expected Outcome 1: Baseline Model (TF-IDF → ML models)**

**You’ve completed this!** Here's what you've done:

- ✅ **Preprocessing**: Cleaned and deduplicated the text data.
- ✅ **Labeling**: Created both **binary** and **multiclass** labels based on keyword matching.
- ✅ **Vectorization**: Used **TF-IDF** to convert text to numerical features.
- ✅ **Class Imbalance Handling**: Applied **SMOTE** for oversampling.
- ✅ **Modeling (Baseline)**:
  - Trained a **Logistic Regression** model with hyperparameter tuning via **GridSearchCV**.
  - Evaluated using **accuracy score** and **classification report**.
  - Cross-validated with **StratifiedKFold**.
- ✅ **Second Model**: Trained and tuned a **Random Forest** model using **RandomizedSearchCV**.

📌 **Status**: ✅ **Baseline model completed**  
📌 **You also experimented with different classifiers and techniques (great initiative!).**

### 🟡 **Expected Outcome 2: LLM-based Model Comparison**

**Not started yet — this is the next big milestone.**

You are expected to:

- Load or fine-tune an LLM (e.g., **BERT**, **BioBERT**, **DistilBERT**) for classification.
- Use either:
  - [ ] **HuggingFace Transformers**
  - [ ] Your own custom training (if dataset size is small/moderate)
- Compare performance (accuracy, F1) with the **TF-IDF + ML baseline**.

📌 **Status**: 🔜 **Next step to start**

### 🔲 **Expected Outcome 3: Few-shot Learning Using LLMs**

You haven't done this part yet either, and it comes **after** you work with a general LLM-based model.

Few-shot learning might include:

- Using LLM APIs (like OpenAI's GPT-4 or Mistral models via HuggingFace) with **prompting** techniques.
- Feeding in a few labeled examples in the prompt and asking the LLM to classify new samples.

📌 **Status**: ⏳ **Pending**, will follow after full LLM model.

### 🔧 Suggested Next Steps

1. **Decide on an LLM**: Start with **DistilBERT** or **BERT** via HuggingFace.
2. **Train or fine-tune it** on your binary label data.
3. **Evaluate performance** and compare it with your current best baseline model.
4. Once done, experiment with **few-shot classification** using prompts.
